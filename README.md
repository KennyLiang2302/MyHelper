## Android Requirements:
The app has networking (GET, POST request), both recycler views and fragments, and 8 unique screens.

## App Description:
My Helper enables users to sign up as tutors or students. Students can see a list of available tutors and send requests to tutors for a tutoring
session. In turn, tutors can see a list of request for tutoring sessions and accept the tutoring sessions that they would like
to partake in. Our app provides a simple way to allow Cornell students to learn from their surrounding community.

When the user first enters the app, they can choose to login if they have a pre-existing account:

Or they can register to make a new account:
